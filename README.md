# Fynstergram
Fynstergram is a German educational computer game about data privacy and identity theft in social media networks. It was created and developed by the [P-Seminar Informatik 2019/21](https://old.wirsberg-gymnasium.de/informatik/pseminar1921) at Wirsberg-Gymnasium Würzburg.

## Requirements
### Users
You have to have a current Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) to be able to run the game.

## Developers
### Good to know
* You need to have Java 8 (JDK) or higher installed on your OS.
* The game uses the [Engine Alpha](https://engine-alpha.org) - an open source game engine developed for educational purposes.
* Obstacles and collision detection are handled by 2D collision maps.
* Dialogues are managed by JSON files.

### Left to do
* Mini games (e.g. slot machine for the gambling den)
* Pet (a dog that follows the main character throughout the game)
