## Requirements
### Users
To be able to run the game, you have to have a current Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).
You find the download and illustrated instructions in German on the [project page](https://old.wirsberg-gymnasium.de/informatik/pseminar1921).

## Developers
### Good to know
* You need to have Java 8 (JDK) or higher installed on your OS.
* The game uses the [Engine Alpha](https://engine-alpha.org) - an open source game engine developed for educational purposes.
* Obstacles and collision detection are handled by 2D collision maps.
* Dialogues are managed by JSON files.

### Left to do
* Mini games (e.g. slot machine for the gambling den)
* Pet (a dog that follows the main character throughout the game)
